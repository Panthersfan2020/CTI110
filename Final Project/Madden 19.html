	<h2>Review</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Madden 19 is a really good football game.</li>
		<li>One fault is that every game they make is the same.</li>
		<li>I would recommend the game to others.</li>
		<li>If you like football you'll like it.</li>
		<li>Another thing that I disagree with is the faces are the same.</li>
		<li>I HATE THE LOOT BOXES!!!.</li>

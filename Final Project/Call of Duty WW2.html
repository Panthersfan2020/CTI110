	<h2>Review</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The Graphics are very good and they can improve over the years.</li>
		<li>The way the game was built was very good and I like the way that they put WW2 into the mix.</li>
		<li>Call of Duty is an alright company and they should stop making games.</li>
		<li>Call of Duty's reign will be over in a couple of years.</li>
